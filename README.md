# Sustainable Transportation and Pavement Lab (STAP)

- Sustainable Transportation and Pavement Lab (STAP)  

The Sustainable Transportation and Pavement Lab (STAP) at the University of Windsor, led by Dr. Abimbola Grace Oyeyi, advances research in sustainable pavement materials, modern pavement design, and resilient transportation infrastructure. 

Our mission is to develop experimental and field evaluation methods to create economical, durable, and sustainable pavement designs, supporting evidence-based policy and management decisions.  

Explore our research on Rubber Recycled Permeable Pavements (RRPPs), finite element modeling (FEM), machine learning applications, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Join us or donate to support innovative solutions for sustainable transportation.
